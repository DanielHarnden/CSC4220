# CSC 4220 Labs

## The following are labs completed for [Tennesee Technological University's CSC 4220 (Data Mining and Machine Learning) Course](https://catalog.tntech.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=29&coid=90700) taught by [Dr. Doug Talbert](https://www.tntech.edu/directory/engineering/faculty/doug-talbert.php) in the Spring 2022 semester. The course was an introduction to machine learning concepts, the labs being used to get the students used to using machine learning in Jupyter Notebook and Python.

### The labs are split into two sections: An introduction to the concept and code provided by Dr. Talbert, and the student coding section. Code sections and prompts provided by Dr. Talbert are marked in green, while the code I wrote to complete the assignments are marked in red and by "Daniel Harnden's Code," which can be searched for ease of access. The following are summaries of each lab, with further information available in each .ipynb file.

<br>

#### 1. Introduction to Jupyter Notebook and Python - A simple assignment to ensure students had their development environments set up correctly and understood how to use Jupyter Notebook and Python.

#### 2. Basic Data Processing and Evaluation - An introduction to Logistic Regression and other early machine learning concepts, and how to impliment them in Python.

#### 3. Linear Regression - An introduction to Linear Regression and gradient descent.

#### 4. Support Vector Machines - An introduction to SVMs.
